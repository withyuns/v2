              <p>I have a real passion for web design, and I believe I have a real talent for designing overall web app with interactions such as databases or user interfaces. I take great pride in my skills, and my design achievements have been recognized from my blog fans. Everytime I work to design, I always enjoy the work. Over the past three years, I've been studying computer science at UCSD and my academic experiences here have really sharpened up my design skills. The courses I've taken here have exposed me to a lot of new technology and has allowed me to work on problem-solving techniques within a collaborative environment. Ideally, I want to design high quality, visually striking products that look great on the outside and work well on the inside.</p>

            <h5>Naver power blogger, reviewer, and judge</h5><br/>

            <p>My blog has opened the door to many life-changing experiences. It has given me the chance to engage with a diverse array of people while expressing my opinions on topics I feel strongly about. Through my blog, I've had the opportunity to be a critic, a judge for a TV show, a promoter, and a marketer. These experiences have taught me so much about the field of communication.</p>

            <h5>Have travelled all around the world</h5><br/>

            <p>One of my greatest passions in life is travel. As a result of the popularity of my blog, Canada Tourism selected me to travel to Toronto and Ottawa to promote the province of Ontario for a travel campaign. In addition, Coca-Cola sent me to South Africa to blog about the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The experiences I had and the people I met on those journeys are memories I will cherish forever. I learned an incredible amount about the importance of diversity from these experiences.</p>
