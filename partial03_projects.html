                    Although Korean culture heavily emphasizes on the value of comformity, I’ve always 
                    wanted to do something creative, and make a unique contribution to society. Being a fan of 
                    Britney Spears, I decided that the best way I could express my support was to develop a website 
                    for her. As a result, this piqued my interest in web-design and web-programming. The website I 
                    created was recognized as Britney’s most popular website in Korea, so Britney’s advertising 
                    agency in Korea proposed that it be the official website of Britney Spears. Through the website I 
                    had learn how to interact with users and receive feedback in real time. I also implimented 
                    changes in reponse to the users as the web-master.

                    <strong>Every information about Britney Spears</strong><br/>
                    A purpose of website is clear. Britney Spears! Many Korean fans of Britney Spears visited the website. When Britney Spears visited Korea, and a server is down because of heavy traffic - It's on Korean news!. I uploaded music videos, all the data in a server, so visitors can watch videos whatever they want to watch. I also served community (discussion board), so everyone can share their opinions through the website. 
                  </p><br/>

                <h3><span class="label label-info">What was troublesome in this project</span></h3>
                  <p>I'm a big fan of Britney Spears, so I created this website with rewards such as free invitation all events. The Korean Britney Organization paid a server to manage website, but it was not enough to manage all traffic occurs for our website. Many of visiors watched music videos, or others just leave comments.. I need more server limitations, so that's big troublesome in managing.
                  </p>

                <h3><span class="label label-info">Wrap Up</span></h3>
                  <p>I never forgot the moment that I created the website and communicate all my visiors. Sometimes I got feedback from them, and I got rewards(compliments) from them, too. Britney Spears finally allowed me to study Computer Science now, and I still have strong passion to do web development. </p>

                    Nowadays Funko pop is very popular and many people are collecting Funko pop characters. Funko pop has various characters from animations, dramas, movies, and games. There are many Funko pop fans around the world, so our website focuses on this phenomenon where fans are interested in the figurines’ aesthetic and considerably cheap prices. Due to this phenomenon, people have collected a large amount of Funko pop characters and at times it is difficult to remember if they have a certain character or not. That is where our project comes in, it acts as a collection website of Funko pop characters where users can add figurines to their online collection. If not, users can put a Funko what they want in their wishlist. From the collection and wishlist users can have a seamless overview and management of their collection whether if they’re just collecting a few or if they have to manage a warehouse full of Funkos. The web application does not require an account to browse the availability of Funkos in the database, but with an account users can manage their collection.

                    <strong>Motivation:</strong><br/>
                    It is difficult to manage a collection in real life due to the limitations of physical space and quantity. Overtime one might misplace or forget about a figurine that they bought and an online collection will aid users in keeping track of their figurines. 
                    Users also want to manage and maintain a list of the characters that they want.
                    Users need a place to browse through to check for new or interesting characters.
                    Users want to read up on the background characters of the figurines that they are adding to their collection or wishlist.<br/>

                    <strong>Authentication:</strong><br/>
                    We are using regular e-mail address and Google authentication as forms of authentication. The programming process of the getting the authentication to work was simple. However, in attempts in trying to be more user friendly, it was actually quite difficult to figure out the errors and determine what kind of display messages should be shown to the user. We decided to go for the classic red highlighted box with a small red error message beneath the form because we felt that an alert would be too intrusive and ruin the user experience.<br/>
                    <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                   
                  <strong>We implemented CRUD functionalities:</strong><br/>
                  <img src="img/proj/funko/01.png" class="col-sm-12"><br/>
                  <strong>Create  </strong><br/>
                  For the create functionality, we are creating a character and setting its information by clicking the “Add missing Funko” button at the bottom of the page which opens a module and asks the user to fill in a form for the Funko character’s data. A character’s data consists of four elements (Name, Franchise, Image URL, Information). At this time, we are using image addresses instead of uploading image files. We decided to depart a little from our wireframe and use a module instead of a separate page because we felt that it would be more practical for a user to be able to fill out a form while on the index (home) page and see the page get updated before one’s eyes instead of being redirected to a form page only to be redirected back to the index page.<br/>
                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                  
                  <img src="img/proj/funko/02.png" class="col-sm-12"><br/>
                  <strong>Read</strong><br/>
                  For the read functionality, in the home page(index.html), the page reads all of the characters’ informational data from the DB and displays a preview image of the character. When a user clicks on the image, the user will be redirected to the character page which will display the data that was collected from the “Add missing Funko” module.<br/>
                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                   
                  The read functionality is also in the profile page(profile.html). In this case, the page reads information about the current user that was set during the signup process. A problem that we ran into with this is with the google authentication. When a user logs into the site with their google account, we found that it completely bypasses our signup form and breaks our profile page. The profile page got broken because it relied on getting the user’s data which is set in the signup forms. So in order to counter the google authentication profile errors we set all of the new google user’s data, except for email, as dummy data. This allowed google users to view their profile page.<br/>
                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                   
                  <img src="img/proj/funko/03.png" class="col-sm-12"><br/>
                  <strong>Update</strong><br/>
                  For the update functionality, in the character page, users are restricted to only being able to update the character information and will be able to see their changes after updating.<br/>
                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                   
                  While in the profile page, users are allowed to update their personal information (profile image with an image url, name with a string, and collection for character with an integer). We found that by implementing the update function in profile, it allowed us to somewhat counter the google profile problem. New google users are prompted by an alert to fill in their name which will complete their profile page. By doing this, it allowed us to fill in the empty form fields that the google authentication skipped from the signup page. <br/>
                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                  
                  <img src="img/proj/funko/04.png" class="col-sm-12"><br/>
                  <strong>Delete</strong><br/>
                  For the delete functionality, in the character page, users can delete a character by clicking “Delete this character”. This will delete the character information in DB, so the information will never be able to be read anymore. After deletion, page redirects to main page. The tricky part about this, as with the update and read was figuring out how to retrieve the unique keys that are associated to the funko characters and user data.<br/>
                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                   
                  We are using vanilla-Javascript to implement the authentication and CRUD functionalities because it is more readable and easier to understand at this time. We found that sticking to using just vanilla-Javascript helped us realize how similar it is and how essential it is to know code proper html. They are very similar in the sense of structure when updating information. This was useful to know when we decided to implement dynamically changing navbars that depended on whether the user was an authenticated user or not onto all of the pages to make the website more cohesive.<br/>

                <h3><span class="label label-info">Challenges</span></h3>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Data hierarchy in Firebase</strong><br/>
                  Even though there are a lot of tutorials out there it was still a little difficult to figure out the data hierarchy in firebase. (For example. ref(cse134bfunko DB) > key > child(each element)), so accessing data that we want was little challenge for us. On top of this, passing data around was a challenge and so to tackle this problem we decided on passing the key around in the query string. Defining the data hierarchy is important at this stage as we scale going into next week, the problems should not require us to restructure our architecture. By having the hierarchy set like this, we can quickly grab the keys when calling funkos to display them on the home/search and set up the query string from there. By having it in the query string, once the user is in the character page we are able to grab the key and then request the appropriate one in funkos/KEY, as well as deleting.<br/>
                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                    
                  <strong>Too many APIs </strong><br/>
                  This relates to the data hierarchy issue, because of the vast amounts of tutorials and references it was difficult to ascertain which method we should use for our prototype. There are many ways(APIs, References) that showed how to implement it, but within each of those resources they all had a different approach handle which confused us. In the end, we decided to stick with vanilla-javascript because it was the most similar to html that we used to format our page.<br/>
                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                   
                  <strong>Data storage</strong><br/>
                  A current problem that we have is data storage. We have tried to find a way to have users upload images to our database and use those, but we were unable to get that to work. We initially tried having a file input type but that gave us something that we were not expecting and did not play well with firebase. All the tutorials we looked at used it in tandem with angular, which was something that we were trying to avoid. So we decided to store image addresses from the web into our DB. However, the problem with this is that users are able to insert image resources that are not valid (such as broken links).<br/>

                <h3><span class="label label-info">Vanilla CSS vs. Bootstrap</span></h3>
                  <img src="img/proj/funko/05.png" class="col-sm-12"><br/>
                  <p>In terms of learning, CSS was more daunting to learn than Bootstrap. This is because CSS has more properties that can be combined in many different ways to make an entirely different web-viewing experience. There is also a vast contrast between CSS and Bootstrap because bootstrap has already done the hard work of grouping CSS properties together and have placed them in classes. By placing the CSS properties in predefined classes, Bootstrap gives users an easy to learn and use experience. Overall it took around two times longer to learn CSS than it did Bootstrap and this is because of the predefined classes.<br/>
                    <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
 
                  However, the downfall of the predefined classes is that Bootstrap feels kind of limiting. It feels limiting because Bootstrap does not include all aspects of CSS. An example of this is creating a hover property on each cell of a table. Bootstrap does not seem to include this option because it decided that hover properties should only be applied to an entire row of the table instead of each cell. This makes the programmer’s style have to adhere to bootstrap’s design standards, such as buttons classes and their predefined grid, which limits some degree of freedom depending on what the documentation allows us to change. Another point that made Bootstrap a little difficult to use is when the programmer wants to edit the Bootstrap CSS file. The Bootstrap CSS file is compressed into one very long line which makes it difficult to edit and figure out what each class is doing. This instead forces the programmer to look at the reference/tutorial site to find out what each class does. <br/>
                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                   
                  CSS and Bootstrap each have their own good qualities of when to employ each approach. Since Bootstrap is easier to use from the start, it will be great to use in situations when the programmer wants to quickly make a nice-looking site without having to put in the effort of learning and grouping all of the CSS properties. However, the downside of this is that the users of the website will experience longer rendering times. Bootstrap pages have a relatively longer to rendering time than normal CSS pages and that is most likely due to having to render less classes and CSS properties.<br/>
                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                   
                  CSS is harder to learn and get into because of all of the different ways that the CSS properties can be combined. But since the programmer has the ability to group the properties in any way that the programmer wants, the programmer is given more control. In addition to the control of how the site looks, the users of the website also gain the benefit of shorter rendering times than Bootstrap pages. <br/>
                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                   
                  In the end, it depends on what the programmer decides on what is more important: saving the programmer’s time from learning CSS or faster rendering times for the user of the website.<br/>

                    For students who do not know anyone in their classes, studying with other people can be difficult. Our project aims to help bring people who need help in class together so that they can achieve their goals. Through GroupUp, students are encouraged to form groups and work with new people in a collaborative setting. We aim to not only facilitate collaboration through online forums, but also make it possible for strangers to meet up in person to collaborate in places like Geisel library.

                  <p>
                    Our app’s unique interaction is being able to create a new group that can either meet in person or work online in a forum. This is unique to our app because most other applications, such as piazza or google forums, only offer a forum-like interaction without giving a nice and quick way to meet up with others in real world to collaborate in a task they are currently working on.
                  </p>

                <h3><span class="label label-info">What I've done</span></h3>
                  <p>
                    This is group project based on extensive discussion within our group. We had weekly discussions to assign tasks per individuals. My main task is to design layout and overall management for our web app. I also managed JSON datas and created related functions to interact with our web app and the data. Our team used Google Analytics to decide most user-friendly design. For example, we didn't know users like 'x' button or 'remove a group' button when they remove groups. From experiment, we decided second option because possiblitiy(traffic) was greater than the first candidate.

                    In the morning, Shuttle buses usually pass the bus stop where I am waiting. I really hate this situation. What other way is there to know how many people there are in line or when the last bus left from the previous bus stop? This app is the solution!
                </div>

                <h3><span class="label label-info">Project Overview</span></h3>
                  <p>
                    This is mobile-app for Android OS. This project is class project in CSE 110 (Software Engineering) at UCSD. We had customer team, so the team gave comments and opinions what they want to have. Our school system has quarter system (We have 10 weeks for a single quarter) so we had 10 weeks to finish the project. What is project about? Take a look!

                  <p><strong>Step 1. Click a bus stop that users want to know.</strong><br/>
                    Once users clicked the but stop, notification bar appears on the top (Screen 2) 
                    We have three status "Empty/Spacious/Full" to tell how full the wait line is. 
                    The app also notify last bus left time that another user reported.<br/><br/>

                  <p><strong>Step 2. Report status in the stop and also just click Bus-Left feature.</strong><br/>
                    The app is user-based app so the more users, the more accurate app.

                <h3><span class="label label-info">Process</span></h3>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Step 1. Meet our customers, and get our assignment.</strong><br/>
                    Our customers gave a good idea of the mobile app that we had to make. That was the "Bus communication app". This is description of our app. "Don't want to wait in a long line for a bus? Then just install the app. You can see when the last bus left and report when the line is full." This is very simple, you just report whenever bus just left or report how full bus is. This is a scenario that our customer described. "Now, I am about to leave, and head to the bus stop. I need to ask someone who tell me how long the bus line is and how full the bus is right now. I have the app "BusBuzz", so that this app tells me how full it is, so that I don't need to wait in a long line!"<br/><br/>

                    <strong>Step 2. Coding. Now turning the plan to reality.</strong><br/>
                    We translated the customer's needs to the actual real world. We used Android Studio program. This program is special for Android mobile developer. It was my first time using this program, so I was very excited to use it! Java is familiar language for me, but it was a long time since I have used it. Android is based on Java language, so I needed time to understand the Android system and new software I needed to make. The rest of time, we wrote the code based on our customers' requests, and sometimes we tried to find bugs or errors that we didn't expect to see. We were CS people so we were all proud of it!<br/><br/>

                    <strong>Step 3. Feedback every week. Process of how real world is</strong><br/>
                    Other than class, we have group meetings every week. We delivered runnable software every week, so we can get any comments and feedbacks from our customers. Sometimes, we tried to reassure them that we were adjusting the app and update them on the process so far. After 10 weeks, we finally finished the app and showed the app to our classmates

                <h3><span class="label label-info">What was troublesome in this project</span></h3>
                  <p>This is actually the first time that I had customers. Of course I didn't get paid by them because it was just a class project, but I had no idea how I had to update the user board or even how to interact with our customers. This is one of learning process in creating software in a team. Second problem is the project was a team-based project. What that means was that we have five members, and we needed to collaborate on the project (developer meeting, communications, even small decisions...). I had many groud projects before, but this is first time we had to create an actual thing (especially CS part). At first, I struggled with group work because it was difficult to make time and decisions, but I learned from many things from this experience. Now we are good friends

                <h3><span class="label label-info">Wrap Up</span></h3>
                  <p>The app was not launched to the Android market, but it was a super good experience that I never experienced before. Mobile apps, Software group project, and all the process during the project. Even updating user story on big board was such a surprise to me. It was interesting and I thought that is so useful to see how our project was currently going. This was just first small mobile-app but from the first experience, I am sure I will make more bigger and more creative mobile app in the future.</p>

              <h3><strong>Project <span class="label label-primary">Britnet Spears Korean Website</span></strong></h3>

                    Although Korean culture heavily emphasizes on the value of comformity, I’ve always 
                    wanted to do something creative, and make a unique contribution to society. Being a fan of 
                    Britney Spears, I decided that the best way I could express my support was to develop a website 
                    for her. As a result, this piqued my interest in web-design and web-programming. The website I 
                    created was recognized as Britney’s most popular website in Korea, so Britney’s advertising 
                    agency in Korea proposed that it be the official website of Britney Spears. Through the website I 
                    had learn how to interact with users and receive feedback in real time. I also implimented 
                    changes in reponse to the users as the web-master.

                  <div class="text-center"><img src="img/proj/britney-demo0.png" style="width: 30%"></div>
                  <p>
                    I created the website, and managed the website. I initially created unofficial Britney Spears fansite by myself. I used normal web editor(Namo Web editor), Photoshop, JavaScript. I was top-3 Britney Spears fansite, and I was suggested to create official Korean Britney Spears website by Britney offical club in Korea. I created the official one, and managed. I used a communicated board using some PHP (At that time, I used ZeroBoard), and modified it.

                    <strong>Every information about Britney Spears</strong><br/>
                    A purpose of website is clear. Britney Spears! Many Korean fans of Britney Spears visited the website. When Britney Spears visited Korea, and a server is down because of heavy traffic - It's on Korean news!. I uploaded music videos, all the data in a server, so visitors can watch videos whatever they want to watch. I also served community (discussion board), so everyone can share their opinions through the website.

                <h3><span class="label label-info">What was troublesome in this project</span></h3>
                  <p>I'm a big fan of Britney Spears, so I created this website with rewards such as free invitation all events. The Korean Britney Organization paid a server to manage website, but it was not enough to manage all traffic occurs for our website. Many of visiors watched music videos, or others just leave comments.. I need more server limitations, so that's big troublesome in managing.
                  </p>

                <h3><span class="label label-info">Wrap Up</span></h3>
                  <p>I never forgot the moment that I created the website and communicate all my visiors. Sometimes I got feedback from them, and I got rewards(compliments) from them, too. Britney Spears finally allowed me to study Computer Science now, and I still have strong passion to do web development. </p>
