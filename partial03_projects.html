                      If you’ve ever been at a loss of what to do when you’re in a new or even local area, then look no further because our app, Locality, will allow you to find the hottest places.<br/><br/>
 
                      We are trying to help people who are unfamiliar with an area to find something to do. The goal of our app is to provide people with a list of businesses and activities to explore based on a specified search or their current location. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                    <img src="img/proj/locality/01.png" class="col-sm-12"><br/>

                    Let’s say that you are visiting La Jolla for the first time and you have no idea where to go. You want to plan a day’s worth of activities but don’t know where to start. 
 
                    Locality can help you achieve this. You can enter keywords into the search and Locality will search either based on your current location or a specified location.

                    <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                    <img src="img/proj/locality/02.png" class="col-sm-12"><br/>

                    After searching, you will be able to see the results on the map in the form of markers that cluster when you zoom out. When clicked, these markers will show a popup with details for that particular place and a button to access reviews. The search results are also displayed in a list with information for each result such as number of reviews, rating, and price.

                    <br/>Below is also a graphic comparison of the businesses’ ratings and number of reviews.
                    <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                    <img src="img/proj/locality/03.png" class="col-sm-12"><br/>
                    Users can also sort the results based on their preferences (price, rating, category, etc.). 

                    Additionally, users are able to favorite places that they might want to visit later either from the ‘Add’ buttons listed in the chart  or on the popup on each marker. 
                     
                    Clicking on the favorited place will bring the mapview to that specific marker. 
                     
                    From the list of favorited places, users can compare metrics such as rating and number of reviews to have a more visual way to distinguish between different options. 
                     
                    With Locality, users are able to explore things to do in a new destination or their local area through searching and comparing different places. 
                  </p>

                <h3><span class="label label-info">Wrap Up</span></h3>
                  <p>
                    <strong>- How to Complete Purpose</strong>
                    Locality takes your current location but a location can be specified for you, in which you can put in a topic you’d be interested in or if you’re unsure, don’t put anything at all and Locality will automatically pick up all the hottest results for you to choose from! You can see what other users have reviewed on these places and add it to your list to save for later.<br/><br/>
                     
                    <strong>- Any extra added functionality</strong>
                    Locality also allows you to visualize all this data easily, allowing you to filter based on what categories these businesses fall in, as well as viewing their ratings and reviews relative to each other on intuitive graph data that it automatically constructs for you.

                      A market database system that handles numerous data in DB, and analyzes data trends such as similar product pairs and top sales based on filters such as category and state. The main features of this app include insert/update/remove data, and also transactions between carts and orders from customers. This app also was developed with efficient performances such as cost and speed. A major purpose for this app is to interact between server-side and client-side. Finally I updated real time data using Ajax call.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3><span class="label label-info">What I've done</span></h3>
                  <p>
                    I had designed SQL queries for both transactions and analytics. The most challenging task I faced was to design queries depending on filters. Based on the filters, I needed to handle different ways to get an appropriate dataset, and spent more time than I expected for designing complicated query (for analytics). For example, there were 16 cases, and I needed to have each query per cases. Usually, I used small datasets to test if my queries are correct by using a program “pgAdmin”. If the test was successful, then I could applied it to Jsp pages. In addition, I measured time to develop better performances.
                    <img src="img/proj/kims/00.png" class="col-sm-12"><br/>
                    <br/>
                    <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                  </p>

                <h3><span class="label label-info">Details</span></h3>
                  <p>
                    <img src="img/proj/kims/02.png" class="col-sm-12"><br/>
                    Our app has two roles - customers and owners. Owners can create categories, products, but customers cannot. Owners can also create/update/delete categories/products. One of the challenging decisions in this project was to decide whether deletion is hard-deletion or soft-deletion. The purpose for this app is not only a transaction but also data analysis. We chose soft-deletion, because we are not losing any data information after purchasing.

                    <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                    <img src="img/proj/kims/03.png" class="col-sm-12"><br/>
                    <img src="img/proj/kims/04.png" class="col-sm-12"><br/>
                    We are using each simple query to show simple datasets (For example, a list of products, a cart, a list of categories, etc).

                    <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                    <img src="img/proj/kims/05.png" class="col-sm-12"><br/>
                    Our app gives a cart and a sales analytics page. After each purchase, all purchase history will be stored in database and owners can view a trend using the sales analytics page.<br/>
 
                    Based on filter, our team is using different queries. Options are in order by Top-20( customers, states, products ), in order by alphabet name, filter by category( specific, all ). <br/>
 
                    We are using an index and precomputation table to get better performances because getting data fast is also a major issue for customers. <br/>
                  </p>

                <h3><span class="label label-info">Wrap Up</span></h3>
                  <p>
                    Even though this was a project that doesn’t have an actual client, I have learned a lot of technical skills and interaction between a server-side and a client-side other than databases itself. I could experience improvements of for databases’ performances, and the time it took was so valuable. I only knew SQL syntax, and applied some SQL statements before this project, and I effectively connected a front-end and a back-end for the project. Using JSP was also a good experience to me, since I couldn’t imagine that I can mix with Java and other web-languages. This was an amazing project that I had finally handled everything from data to visualizing.

                    <p>Our project is to assist the Cruz Roja (Red Cross) of Tijuana in managing their limited resources to best serve their community. For some background, Tijuana has a growing population of more than 1 million people, but their ambulance service is run by the Red Cross and only has about 8 ambulances on duty at any given time. Using historical data, Cruz Roja and students at the Tijuana Institute of Technology found that they can optimize their ambulance service to great effect, but have not yet implemented such a solution. Overall, this is a difficult problem that requires great care and diligence in addressing, but we aim to find a way to best use the limited resources available in Tijuana.<br/><br/>

                  <p>
                    Our users are dispatchers in police stations. However, one thing that we take care about is dispatchers are still interacting with others such as ambulance drivers, server managers, or even callers/injured persons. For example, dispatchers receive all the information from a call, and dispatchers dispatches ambulances by putting that information using our app, so drivers or other members know the information. The one thing they need to decide is how severely people hurt because they need to decide number of ambulances, size of ambulance. Or even depends on situations, they need to reassign ambulance appropriately.<br/>

                <h3><span class="label label-info">What I've done</span></h3>
                  <p>
                    My design was selected as an our prototype, and I made prototype to actual product (drawing to coding). The design should be considered by dispatchers’ view, so I designed carefully. I could contribute overall project in same way because that is one of my great talent (I believe so), and front-end web components is also important feature when dispatchers really uses our app.
                    Our team plan for this quarter is to focus on a function of dispatching ambulances. We also had some To-do things such as fixing bugs from last quarter and changed marker designs. Most tasks were to design dispatch panel and all functionality in it.  We basically have done main feature (which is dispatching) and we tested our app. In summary, the most important thing is to report the exact address where ambulance heading to. After dispatchers type address(regular form), they can pick more specific point by clicking the map. They can click ambulance needed (like, how many ambulances OR which ambulances - specifically). After dispatching ambulances, users also can see the result - dispatching informations.

                  <strong>Main goal</strong><br/>
                  Our main goal for this quarter is to implement a dispatcher function so that dispatchers can select an ambulance, fill out the details such as the location, priority level and dispatch the ambulance. The call will be recorded to the server and the calls page will display all dispatched calls.

                  <img src="img/proj/cruz/03.png" class="col-sm-12"><br/>
                  <strong>How it works</strong><br/>
                  Main job for dispatchers is to report most accurate location of injured person, so we are using two types of address (Street address and Coordinates). I connected a form and auto-filling address bar by Google API. After typing the address, Google API (GeoCoder) automatically converts it to coordinates. Once it starts to dispatch, the dispatching function creates a pin marker based on either address input or the user clicking on the map. It keeps  track of coordinates that means more accurate location than usual addresses. A list of Ambulances is displaying only available ambulances, and it is updating dynamically. The dispatcher form takes multiple (or single) ambulances as array to be reported to a server. Priority made by radio button, and it allow user to click only one of them.

                  <strong>In out dispatcher development team, other member worked ambulance grid(top), the other member worked ambulances' list page. So we worked main features of ambulance dispatchers' web app.</strong><br/>

                    Nowadays Funko pop is very popular and many people are collecting Funko pop characters. Funko pop has various characters from animations, dramas, movies, and games. There are many Funko pop fans around the world, so our website focuses on this phenomenon where fans are interested in the figurines’ aesthetic and considerably cheap prices. Due to this phenomenon, people have collected a large amount of Funko pop characters and at times it is difficult to remember if they have a certain character or not. That is where our project comes in, it acts as a collection website of Funko pop characters where users can add figurines to their online collection. If not, users can put a Funko what they want in their wishlist. From the collection and wishlist users can have a seamless overview and management of their collection whether if they’re just collecting a few or if they have to manage a warehouse full of Funkos. The web application does not require an account to browse the availability of Funkos in the database, but with an account users can manage their collection.

                  <p>
                    <strong>Motivation:</strong><br/>
                    It is difficult to manage a collection in real life due to the limitations of physical space and quantity. Overtime one might misplace or forget about a figurine that they bought and an online collection will aid users in keeping track of their figurines. 
                    Users also want to manage and maintain a list of the characters that they want.
                    Users need a place to browse through to check for new or interesting characters.
                    Users want to read up on the background characters of the figurines that they are adding to their collection or wishlist.<br/>
                    <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                    <strong>Features:</strong><br/>
                    Manage collection and wishlist
                    Browse and search through a database of Funko pop characters
                    Add missing Funko pop characters that are not in the database
                    Quantify the amount of a figurine that a user has when adding to their collection
                    Add characters to a collection or wishlist
                    Read up on a character’s background
                    Quickly find out if a figurine is still available for sale or if it has been vaulted<br/>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Authentication:</strong><br/>
                    We are using regular e-mail address and Google authentication as forms of authentication. The programming process of the getting the authentication to work was simple. However, in attempts in trying to be more user friendly, it was actually quite difficult to figure out the errors and determine what kind of display messages should be shown to the user. We decided to go for the classic red highlighted box with a small red error message beneath the form because we felt that an alert would be too intrusive and ruin the user experience.<br/>
                    <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                   
                  <strong>We implemented CRUD functionalities:</strong><br/>
                  <img src="img/proj/funko/01.png" class="col-sm-12"><br/>
                  <strong>Create  </strong><br/>
                  For the create functionality, we are creating a character and setting its information by clicking the “Add missing Funko” button at the bottom of the page which opens a module and asks the user to fill in a form for the Funko character’s data. A character’s data consists of four elements (Name, Franchise, Image URL, Information). At this time, we are using image addresses instead of uploading image files. We decided to depart a little from our wireframe and use a module instead of a separate page because we felt that it would be more practical for a user to be able to fill out a form while on the index (home) page and see the page get updated before one’s eyes instead of being redirected to a form page only to be redirected back to the index page.<br/>
                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                  
                  <img src="img/proj/funko/02.png" class="col-sm-12"><br/>
                  <strong>Read</strong><br/>
                  For the read functionality, in the home page(index.html), the page reads all of the characters’ informational data from the DB and displays a preview image of the character. When a user clicks on the image, the user will be redirected to the character page which will display the data that was collected from the “Add missing Funko” module.<br/>
                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                   
                  The read functionality is also in the profile page(profile.html). In this case, the page reads information about the current user that was set during the signup process. A problem that we ran into with this is with the google authentication. When a user logs into the site with their google account, we found that it completely bypasses our signup form and breaks our profile page. The profile page got broken because it relied on getting the user’s data which is set in the signup forms. So in order to counter the google authentication profile errors we set all of the new google user’s data, except for email, as dummy data. This allowed google users to view their profile page.<br/>
                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                   
                  <img src="img/proj/funko/03.png" class="col-sm-12"><br/>
                  <strong>Update</strong><br/>
                  For the update functionality, in the character page, users are restricted to only being able to update the character information and will be able to see their changes after updating.<br/>
                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                   
                  While in the profile page, users are allowed to update their personal information (profile image with an image url, name with a string, and collection for character with an integer). We found that by implementing the update function in profile, it allowed us to somewhat counter the google profile problem. New google users are prompted by an alert to fill in their name which will complete their profile page. By doing this, it allowed us to fill in the empty form fields that the google authentication skipped from the signup page. <br/>
                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                  
                  <img src="img/proj/funko/04.png" class="col-sm-12"><br/>
                  <strong>Delete</strong><br/>
                  For the delete functionality, in the character page, users can delete a character by clicking “Delete this character”. This will delete the character information in DB, so the information will never be able to be read anymore. After deletion, page redirects to main page. The tricky part about this, as with the update and read was figuring out how to retrieve the unique keys that are associated to the funko characters and user data.<br/>
                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                   
                  We are using vanilla-Javascript to implement the authentication and CRUD functionalities because it is more readable and easier to understand at this time. We found that sticking to using just vanilla-Javascript helped us realize how similar it is and how essential it is to know code proper html. They are very similar in the sense of structure when updating information. This was useful to know when we decided to implement dynamically changing navbars that depended on whether the user was an authenticated user or not onto all of the pages to make the website more cohesive.<br/>

                <h3><span class="label label-info">Challenges</span></h3>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Data hierarchy in Firebase</strong><br/>
                  Even though there are a lot of tutorials out there it was still a little difficult to figure out the data hierarchy in firebase. (For example. ref(cse134bfunko DB) > key > child(each element)), so accessing data that we want was little challenge for us. On top of this, passing data around was a challenge and so to tackle this problem we decided on passing the key around in the query string. Defining the data hierarchy is important at this stage as we scale going into next week, the problems should not require us to restructure our architecture. By having the hierarchy set like this, we can quickly grab the keys when calling funkos to display them on the home/search and set up the query string from there. By having it in the query string, once the user is in the character page we are able to grab the key and then request the appropriate one in funkos/KEY, as well as deleting.<br/>
                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                    
                  <strong>Too many APIs </strong><br/>
                  This relates to the data hierarchy issue, because of the vast amounts of tutorials and references it was difficult to ascertain which method we should use for our prototype. There are many ways(APIs, References) that showed how to implement it, but within each of those resources they all had a different approach handle which confused us. In the end, we decided to stick with vanilla-javascript because it was the most similar to html that we used to format our page.<br/>
                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                   
                  <strong>Data storage</strong><br/>
                  A current problem that we have is data storage. We have tried to find a way to have users upload images to our database and use those, but we were unable to get that to work. We initially tried having a file input type but that gave us something that we were not expecting and did not play well with firebase. All the tutorials we looked at used it in tandem with angular, which was something that we were trying to avoid. So we decided to store image addresses from the web into our DB. However, the problem with this is that users are able to insert image resources that are not valid (such as broken links).<br/>

                <h3><span class="label label-info">Vanilla CSS vs. Bootstrap</span></h3>
                  <img src="img/proj/funko/05.png" class="col-sm-12"><br/>
                  <p>In terms of learning, CSS was more daunting to learn than Bootstrap. This is because CSS has more properties that can be combined in many different ways to make an entirely different web-viewing experience. There is also a vast contrast between CSS and Bootstrap because bootstrap has already done the hard work of grouping CSS properties together and have placed them in classes. By placing the CSS properties in predefined classes, Bootstrap gives users an easy to learn and use experience. Overall it took around two times longer to learn CSS than it did Bootstrap and this is because of the predefined classes.<br/>
                    <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
 
                  However, the downfall of the predefined classes is that Bootstrap feels kind of limiting. It feels limiting because Bootstrap does not include all aspects of CSS. An example of this is creating a hover property on each cell of a table. Bootstrap does not seem to include this option because it decided that hover properties should only be applied to an entire row of the table instead of each cell. This makes the programmer’s style have to adhere to bootstrap’s design standards, such as buttons classes and their predefined grid, which limits some degree of freedom depending on what the documentation allows us to change. Another point that made Bootstrap a little difficult to use is when the programmer wants to edit the Bootstrap CSS file. The Bootstrap CSS file is compressed into one very long line which makes it difficult to edit and figure out what each class is doing. This instead forces the programmer to look at the reference/tutorial site to find out what each class does. <br/>
                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                   
                  CSS and Bootstrap each have their own good qualities of when to employ each approach. Since Bootstrap is easier to use from the start, it will be great to use in situations when the programmer wants to quickly make a nice-looking site without having to put in the effort of learning and grouping all of the CSS properties. However, the downside of this is that the users of the website will experience longer rendering times. Bootstrap pages have a relatively longer to rendering time than normal CSS pages and that is most likely due to having to render less classes and CSS properties.<br/>
                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                   
                  CSS is harder to learn and get into because of all of the different ways that the CSS properties can be combined. But since the programmer has the ability to group the properties in any way that the programmer wants, the programmer is given more control. In addition to the control of how the site looks, the users of the website also gain the benefit of shorter rendering times than Bootstrap pages. <br/>
                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                   
                  In the end, it depends on what the programmer decides on what is more important: saving the programmer’s time from learning CSS or faster rendering times for the user of the website.<br/>

                    For students who do not know anyone in their classes, studying with other people can be difficult. Our project aims to help bring people who need help in class together so that they can achieve their goals. Through GroupUp, students are encouraged to form groups and work with new people in a collaborative setting. We aim to not only facilitate collaboration through online forums, but also make it possible for strangers to meet up in person to collaborate in places like Geisel library.

                  <p>
                    Our app’s unique interaction is being able to create a new group that can either meet in person or work online in a forum. This is unique to our app because most other applications, such as piazza or google forums, only offer a forum-like interaction without giving a nice and quick way to meet up with others in real world to collaborate in a task they are currently working on.
                  </p>

                <h3><span class="label label-info">What I've done</span></h3>
                  <p>
                    This is group project based on extensive discussion within our group. We had weekly discussions to assign tasks per individuals. My main task is to design layout and overall management for our web app. I also managed JSON datas and created related functions to interact with our web app and the data. Our team used Google Analytics to decide most user-friendly design. For example, we didn't know users like 'x' button or 'remove a group' button when they remove groups. From experiment, we decided second option because possiblitiy(traffic) was greater than the first candidate.

                      To join or create a group, users need to add a class first. Let’s add CSE 170/COGS 120.

                    <br/><strong>Join group</strong><br/> “This group isn’t working for me - maybe time schedule?”
                      Next, we can see a list of groups already created by clicking on the class. Let’s join “midterm #2”. After 
                    joining, you can see relevant information pertaining to the group.
                    <br/><strong>Leave group </strong><br/>
                      Once we’ve finished studying, we can leave the group so it will no longer show up on our main page.

                    <br/><strong>Create group</strong><br/> 
                      Even though we don’t have a final for this class, let’s create group for the final.
                      We can do this by going to the class page, and clicking the create group button. Let’s say we want to 
                    study for the final this Sunday night.

                    <br/><strong>Remove group</strong><br/>
                    Since we don’t actually have final, we might want to delete the group so that people don’t continue trying to join it. We can do this in the settings page by clicking the delete group button.

                  <p><br/><strong>The point of view: </strong><br/>
                  Trying to find people to study with from the same class shouldn’t be difficult when you are on campus or in close proximity to students. 
                   
                  <br/><strong>Project concept: </strong><br/>
                  Collaborate with students from your classes, whether it’s studying for a test or working on a group project, finding a group should never be difficult!
                   
                  <br/><strong>User needs: </strong><br/>
                  Students can’t find others to study with outside of class if they don’t know anyone in the class.

                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                    In the morning, Shuttle buses usually pass the bus stop where I am waiting. I really hate this situation. What other way is there to know how many people there are in line or when the last bus left from the previous bus stop? This app is the solution!
                </div>

                <h3><span class="label label-info">Project Overview</span></h3>
                  <p>
                    This is mobile-app for Android OS. This project is class project in CSE 110 (Software Engineering) at UCSD. We had customer team, so the team gave comments and opinions what they want to have. Our school system has quarter system (We have 10 weeks for a single quarter) so we had 10 weeks to finish the project. What is project about? Take a look!
                  </p>

                  <p><strong>Step 1. Click a bus stop that users want to know.</strong><br/>
                    Once users clicked the but stop, notification bar appears on the top (Screen 2) 
                    We have three status "Empty/Spacious/Full" to tell how full the wait line is. 
                    The app also notify last bus left time that another user reported.<br/><br/>
                  </p>
                  <img src="img/proj/busbuzz_demo02.png" class="col-sm-12">
                  

                  <p><strong>Step 2. Report status in the stop and also just click Bus-Left feature.</strong><br/>
                    The app is user-based app so the more users, the more accurate app.
                  </p>

                <h3><span class="label label-info">Process</span></h3>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Step 1. Meet our customers, and get our assignment.</strong><br/>
                    Our customers gave a good idea of the mobile app that we had to make. That was the "Bus communication app". This is description of our app. "Don't want to wait in a long line for a bus? Then just install the app. You can see when the last bus left and report when the line is full." This is very simple, you just report whenever bus just left or report how full bus is. This is a scenario that our customer described. "Now, I am about to leave, and head to the bus stop. I need to ask someone who tell me how long the bus line is and how full the bus is right now. I have the app "BusBuzz", so that this app tells me how full it is, so that I don't need to wait in a long line!"<br/><br/>

                    <strong>Step 2. Coding. Now turning the plan to reality.</strong><br/>
                    We translated the customer's needs to the actual real world. We used Android Studio program. This program is special for Android mobile developer. It was my first time using this program, so I was very excited to use it! Java is familiar language for me, but it was a long time since I have used it. Android is based on Java language, so I needed time to understand the Android system and new software I needed to make. The rest of time, we wrote the code based on our customers' requests, and sometimes we tried to find bugs or errors that we didn't expect to see. We were CS people so we were all proud of it!<br/><br/>

                    <strong>Step 3. Feedback every week. Process of how real world is</strong><br/>
                    Other than class, we have group meetings every week. We delivered runnable software every week, so we can get any comments and feedbacks from our customers. Sometimes, we tried to reassure them that we were adjusting the app and update them on the process so far. After 10 weeks, we finally finished the app and showed the app to our classmates
                  </p><br/>

                <h3><span class="label label-info">What was troublesome in this project</span></h3>
                  <p>This is actually the first time that I had customers. Of course I didn't get paid by them because it was just a class project, but I had no idea how I had to update the user board or even how to interact with our customers. This is one of learning process in creating software in a team. Second problem is the project was a team-based project. What that means was that we have five members, and we needed to collaborate on the project (developer meeting, communications, even small decisions...). I had many groud projects before, but this is first time we had to create an actual thing (especially CS part). At first, I struggled with group work because it was difficult to make time and decisions, but I learned from many things from this experience. Now we are good friends
                  </p>

                <h3><span class="label label-info">Wrap Up</span></h3>
                  <p>The app was not launched to the Android market, but it was a super good experience that I never experienced before. Mobile apps, Software group project, and all the process during the project. Even updating user story on big board was such a surprise to me. It was interesting and I thought that is so useful to see how our project was currently going. This was just first small mobile-app but from the first experience, I am sure I will make more bigger and more creative mobile app in the future.</p>

                  <div class="space_paddig" style="height: 20px;"></div>
                    Although Korean culture heavily emphasizes on the value of comformity, I’ve always 
                    wanted to do something creative, and make a unique contribution to society. Being a fan of 
                    Britney Spears, I decided that the best way I could express my support was to develop a website 
                    for her. As a result, this piqued my interest in web-design and web-programming. The website I 
                    created was recognized as Britney’s most popular website in Korea, so Britney’s advertising 
                    agency in Korea proposed that it be the official website of Britney Spears. Through the website I 
                    had learn how to interact with users and receive feedback in real time. I also implimented 
                    changes in reponse to the users as the web-master.

                  <div class="text-center"><img src="img/proj/britney-demo0.PNG" style="width: 30%"></div>
                  <p>
                    I created the website, and managed the website. I initially created unofficial Britney Spears fansite by myself. I used normal web editor(Namo Web editor), Photoshop, JavaScript. I was top-3 Britney Spears fansite, and I was suggested to create official Korean Britney Spears website by Britney offical club in Korea. I created the official one, and managed. I used a communicated board using some PHP (At that time, I used ZeroBoard), and modified it.

                  <p>
                    <strong>Every information about Britney Spears</strong><br/>
                    A purpose of website is clear. Britney Spears! Many Korean fans of Britney Spears visited the website. When Britney Spears visited Korea, and a server is down because of heavy traffic - It's on Korean news!. I uploaded music videos, all the data in a server, so visitors can watch videos whatever they want to watch. I also served community (discussion board), so everyone can share their opinions through the website. 
                  </p><br/>

                <h3><span class="label label-info">What was troublesome in this project</span></h3>
                  <p>I'm a big fan of Britney Spears, so I created this website with rewards such as free invitation all events. The Korean Britney Organization paid a server to manage website, but it was not enough to manage all traffic occurs for our website. Many of visiors watched music videos, or others just leave comments.. I need more server limitations, so that's big troublesome in managing.
                  </p>

                <h3><span class="label label-info">Wrap Up</span></h3>
                  <p>I never forgot the moment that I created the website and communicate all my visiors. Sometimes I got feedback from them, and I got rewards(compliments) from them, too. Britney Spears finally allowed me to study Computer Science now, and I still have strong passion to do web development. </p>
